Let's get started.
We offer two types of implementation. Easy way and advanced way. In order to make our player work on your website the advanced way you need a server with PHP and cURL or file_get_contents enabled. You download our player php file and upload it to your website. This file calls our server for a player url and then redirects to it.

Simple way
Just paste url to iframe. No extra files needed. Works on all servers, even Blogger.

Request movie by IMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/?video_id=tt8385148
Request movie by TMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/?video_id=522931&tmdb=1
Request episode by IMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/?video_id=tt13157618&s=1&e=2
Request episode by TMDB id: https://multiembed.mov/?video_id=114472&tmdb=1&s=1&e=2

Paste these urls to iframe and the player will appear there. Just change imdb or tmdb id.
For IMDB id you can use tt0000000 or just number 0000000.
For season and episode parameters you can use s=1&e=1 or season=1&episode=1.
Don't forget to always include &tmdb=1 if using TMDB id.

NEW! Request VIP player
With this method you can request only VIP player (multi quality, fast HLS streaming, subtitles) with just one popup ad. If the requested movie/episode is not available with VIP player our normal player will be used.

You can Check if VIP player is available by adding &check=1. Returns 0 if not available and 1 if available.

You can Add your own subtitles by adding &sub_url and &sub_label parameters. Your subtitles will appear first in list and autoplay. Must be urlencoded!
